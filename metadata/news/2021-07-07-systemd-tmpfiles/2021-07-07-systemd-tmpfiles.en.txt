A tmpfiles [0] implementation provides a generic mechanism to define
the creation of regular files, directories, pipes, and device nodes,
adjustments to their access mode, ownership, attributes, quota
assignments, and contents, and finally their time-based removal.
It is commonly used for volatile and temporary files and directories
such as those located under /run/, /tmp/, /var/tmp/, the API file
systems such as /sys/ or /proc/, as well as some other directories
below /var/. [1]

On 2021-07-06, the sys-apps/opentmpfiles package was masked due to a
root privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2017-18925 [2],
bug #751415 [3], issue 4 [4] upstream).

The use of opentmpfiles is discouraged by its maintainer due to the
unpatched vulnerability and other long-standing bugs [5].

Users will start seeing their package manager trying to replace
sys-apps/opentmpfiles with sys-apps/systemd-tmpfiles because it is
another provider of virtual/tmpfiles.

Despite the name, 'systemd-tmpfiles' does not depend on systemd, does
not use dbus, and is just a drop-in replacement for opentmpfiles. It is
a small binary built from systemd source code, but works separately,
similarly to eudev or elogind. It is known to work on both glibc and
musl systems.

Note that systemd-tmpfiles is specifically for non-systemd systems. It
is intended to be used on an OpenRC system.

If you wish to selectively test systemd-tmpfiles, follow those steps:

 1. # emerge --oneshot sys-apps/systemd-tmpfiles
 2. # reboot
 3. # rm /etc/runlevels/boot/opentmpfiles-setup
 4. # rm /etc/runlevels/sysinit/opentmpfiles-dev

No other steps required.

If, after reviewing the linked bug reference for opentmpfiles, you feel
your system is not vulnerable/applicable to the attack described, you
can unmask [6] opentmpfiles at your own risk:

 1. In /etc/portage/package.unmask, add a line:
 -sys-apps/opentmpfiles-
 2. # emerge --oneshot sys-apps/opentmpfiles

Note that opentmpfiles is likely to be removed from gentoo repository
in the future.
